# blood-cell-cnn
CNN-based deep learning model for classifying cell images (Akbank Deep Learning Bootcamp project.)
# Project Goal:
This project was done as part of the "Akbank Deep Learning Bootcamp". The goal is to build a CNN-based deep learning model to classify cell images. We worked on data preprocessing, building the model, and evaluating its performance.
# Dataset
The dataset was taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadamireshraghi/blood-cell-cancer-all-4class/data).
Uploaded by: Robin Eshraghi (Owner) and Mustafa Ghaderzadeh (Editor).
It has 4 classes: Benign, Pre-B, Pro-B, Early Pre-B.
All images were resized to 150x150 pixels for training.
# Expected Outcomes
Develop a CNN model for classification
Apply data augmentation for more data variety
Show results with Accuracy/Loss plots
Evaluate with Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and Grad-CAM
